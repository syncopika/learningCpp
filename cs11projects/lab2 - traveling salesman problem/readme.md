This lab utilizes the Point class created in lab1.    

Here, a brute-force way of solving the 'Traveling Salesman Problem' is demonstrated.    
A number of points is inputted by the user and the program looks for the path that yields the smallest distance, while traversing all the points.

The program is pretty quick for a few points, maybe up to 8, but gets significantly worse as the number of points to use increases.
