got the idea for making this while watching Casey Muratori's interview with Mike Acton at HandmadeCon 2015 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWJpI2adCcs)
At around 1:01:35 Casey Muratori mentions it.

- collision detection with player
- more efficient collision detection? like using a quadtree? :D
- possible to get smoother movement, especially when turning? (be able 'drift' like in the real asteroids game)
- don't have lasers rotate with the player after being fired lol
