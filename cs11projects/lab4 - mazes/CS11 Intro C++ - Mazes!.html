<title>CS11 Intro C++ - Mazes!</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Mazes!</h1>
<p>
This week you will create a class to represent mazes.  Mazes are a bit tricky
because the most important things - the walls - sit between the cells.
Let's say we have the following maze:
</p>

<img src="./CS11 Intro C++ - Mazes!_files/maze.png" alt="3x4 maze">

<p>
The cells form a 2D grid, which we shall reference with (<em>row</em>,
<em>column</em>) coordinates.  Cell (0, 0) is the starting point, and cell
(2, 3) is the ending point.
</p>

<p>
We can represent the maze with an array, but we also need to be able to store
the walls somewhere.  One approach for representing mazes is to add extra rows
and columns between cells, where the walls themselves will be represented.
Therefore, the above maze would be stored like this:
</p>

<p>
The green boxes are the cells themselves, and the yellow boxes represent the
walls.  The white boxes are unused in this representation, which may seem a
bit wasteful, but we won't be creating giant mazes, so we'll pick a clear and
slightly wasteful representation, rather than a confusing and extremely
efficient one.
</p>

<p>
You can see that for a maze of size
<em>N<sub>rows</sub></em>×<em>N<sub>cols</sub></em>,
our representation requires a total of
(2<em>N<sub>rows</sub></em> + 1) × (2<em>N<sub>cols</sub></em> + 1)
elements.  For our above example, with 3 rows and 4 columns, we would need
(2 * 3 + 1) × (2 * 4 + 1) cells, or 7×9 cells.
</p>

<h2>C++ and Multidimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>
As mentioned in class, C++ doesn't have very good support for dynamically
allocated multidimensional arrays; languages like Java are much better at this
kind of thing.  In C++, we typically allocate a 1-dimensional array with enough
space for the <u>total</u> number of elements, and then map our 2D (or 3D, or
whatever) coordinates into our 1D array.  For example, given a 2D array with
<em>N<sub>rows</sub></em> rows and <em>N<sub>cols</sub></em> columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The program can allocate a 1D array with
    <em>N<sub>rows</sub></em>×<em>N<sub>cols</sub></em> elements</li>
<li>An element at 2D position (<em>row</em>, <em>col</em>) can be mapped to
    <em>row</em>×<em>N<sub>cols</sub></em> + <em>col</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
This mapping should make sense:  for each row we are going to skip, we must
move past <em>N<sub>cols</sub></em> cells to get to the next row.  Of course,
this is not the only way we can map 2D coordinates into the 1D array, but this
is the typical approach for C and C++.  It is called a <em>row-major order</em>.
(A few other languages, like Matlab and Fortran, use a <em>column-major
order</em> for how they represent multidimensional arrays.)
</p>

<h2>Accessing Maze Cells and Walls</h2>

<p>
In order to provide a simple abstraction for people to use, we will implement a
<tt>Maze</tt> class that uses <em>cell coordinates</em> to reference various
aspects of the maze, but internally we will map cell coordinates into the
"expanded representation" we use internally.  We will call the coordinates in
the expanded representation <em>expanded coordinates</em>.
</p>

<p>
You should be able to see how to map cell coordinates into expanded coordinates
very easily.  Given a maze with
<em>N<sub>cell-rows</sub></em> × <em>N<sub>cell-cols</sub></em> cells,
we can map the cell coordinates
(<em>r<sub>cell</sub></em>, <em>c<sub>cell</sub></em>) into expanded
coordinates (<em>r<sub>exp</sub></em>, <em>c<sub>exp</sub></em>) as follows:

</p><ul>
<li><em>r<sub>exp</sub></em> = 2 <em>r<sub>cell</sub></em> + 1</li>
<li><em>c<sub>exp</sub></em> = 2 <em>c<sub>cell</sub></em> + 1</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given a particular cell, we will want to know if there is a wall on a particular side of the cell; we will use the cardinal directions "North", "East", "South" or "West" of the cell.  Then, we can ask questions like:

</p><ul>
<li>Is there a wall to the west (left) of cell (1, 2) in the original maze?
    <b>Yes.</b></li>
<li>Is there a wall to the north of cell (2, 3) in the maze?  <b>No.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
Accessing the walls between cells is similarly straightforward:
</p>

<ul>
<li>To access the wall north of a given cell, compute the cell's expanded
    coordinates and subtract 1 from the row value.</li>
<li>To access the wall south of a given cell, compute the cell's expanded
    coordinates and add 1 to the row value.</li>
<li>To access the wall east of a given cell, compute the cell's expanded
    coordinates and add 1 to the column value.</li>
<li>To access the wall west of a given cell, compute the cell's expanded
    coordinates and subtract 1 from the column value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Tasks</h2>

<p>
This week you will need to complete the implementation of the <tt>Maze</tt>
class.  There are quite a few member functions to implement, but you should not
worry about this since the vast majority of them will end up being only a few
lines long, at most.  Only a few of these functions will actually require
careful thought.
</p>

<p>
To help you know what you need to do, we are providing you with
<a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab4/maze-initial.hh">an initial version of <tt>maze.hh</tt></a>, which
you can download and then rename to <tt>maze.hh</tt>.  This file contains the
following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A declaration of the <tt>Maze</tt> class, which includes all operations
    you must support.  Feel free to add member functions if you wish (in
    particular, private helper functions), but don't change the public 
    interface that the class specifies!</li>
<li>A <tt>MazeCell</tt> enumeration that specifies all the values that cells in
    the expanded representation of the maze can take on.  You should not need
    to change this.</li>
<li>A <tt>Direction</tt> enumeration that specifies the cardinal directions that
    are used by the maze code.  You should not need to change this.</li>
<li>A <tt>Location</tt> class that can be used to represent (row, column)
    locations.  You shouldn't need to make any changes to this class.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason for the <tt>Location</tt> class is that C++ functions cannot return
more than one value, but it is very helpful to be able to return a (row,col)
value from various functions.  Thus, we can package the row and column value
into a <tt>Location</tt> object, and return that object from a function.
</p>

<p>
The required operations in the maze class are explained in the comments in the
<tt>maze.hh</tt> header file.  Feel free to ask for any clarifications.
</p>

<h2>Suggested Approach</h2>

<p>
You will need to dynamically allocate an array for the expanded representation
of the maze using the heap.  Since you are dynamically allocating memory, you
will need to write a destructor to free the memory, and a copy-constructor and
an assignment operator to handle copying and assignment correctly.  (That is,
you will need to perform a deep copy, not a shallow copy.)  This is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming)"><b>Rule of Three</b></a> -
if you implement a copy-constructor, assignment operator, or destructor for your class, you really should implement all three.
</p>

<p>
If you create simple abstractions for your class, you will find that your implementation goes much easier.  For example, you might want to create these
private helper functions (i.e. declare them in the <tt>private</tt> section of your class):
</p>

<pre>  // Take 2D expanded coordinates and compute the corresponding 1D array index
  int getArrayIndex(const Location &amp;loc) const;

  // Returns the expanded coordinates of the specified cell coordinates
  Location getCellArrayCoord(int cellRow, int cellCol) const;
  
  // Returns the expanded coordinates of the wall on a specific side of
  // a cell given in cell coordinates
  Location getWallArrayCoord(int cellRow, int cellCol,
                             Direction direction) const;</pre>

<p>
Then, your other functions can use these helpers to perform their tasks.  By
taking this approach, you minimize the number of places where you will have to
write the tricky array-indexing operations that are so easy to get wrong.  If
you have bugs, you will only have to fix them in one place.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use assertions liberally!</b>  Here are some ideas; if you see other places
to use assertions, put them there too!
</p>

<ul>
<li>Check every set of incoming coordinates to be sure they are in the proper
    range.</li>
<li>Check row coordinates and column coordinates in separate assertions.</li>
<li>As indicated in the comments for <tt>getNeighborCell()</tt>, trip an
    assertion if someone tries to get a neighbor cell that is invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Probably the hardest function to write will be the <tt>print()</tt> function.
You can use the &lt;&lt; stream-output operator on the <tt>ostream</tt> object,
just as if it were <tt>cout</tt>.  You may want to follow a structure like the
following:
</p>

<pre>  Output the number of cell-rows and cell-columns
  
  For each row r from 0 to numRows - 1:
      Output the walls above row r
      Output the cells in row r, along with the walls in between those cells
      
  Finally, output the walls below the last row</pre>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>
You can download <a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab4/testmaze.tgz">this program</a> to exercise your
maze code.  It performs a pretty exhaustive battery of tests, so by the time
your program passes all the tests, you should have a pretty high confidence
that it works.  You can compile and run the test program like this:
</p>

<pre>  g++ -Wall -std=c++14 maze.cc test-maze.cc testbase.cc -o test-maze
  ./test-maze</pre>

<h2>All Done?</h2>

<p>
When you have finished your maze program, you should submit your completed
<tt>maze.hh</tt> and <tt>maze.cc</tt> files on csman.
