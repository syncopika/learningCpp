trying out the SDL library! :D    
hoping to make a neat, small game eventually >_<    
    
demo1: this demo demonstrates some features of SDL, such as image loading, image scaling, converting surface to texture, and handling some basic input like mouse clicks.    
demo2: this demo shows how you can move a sprite based on keyboard input.
