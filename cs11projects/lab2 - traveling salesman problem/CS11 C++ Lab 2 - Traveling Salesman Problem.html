<h2>CS11 C++ Lab 2 - Traveling Salesman Problem</h2>

<p>
In this assignment you will start using the C++ Standard Template library to
implement a solution to the very well-known
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Traveling
Salesman Problem</a>.
</p>

<p>
You will need to write a program in the file <tt>tsp.cc</tt> that runs as
follows:
</p>

<pre>  How many points?  <em>5</em>
  Point 0:  <em>9 0 3</em>
  Point 1:  <em>4 4 2</em>
  Point 2:  <em>6 7 3</em>
  Point 3:  <em>1 9 5</em>
  Point 4:  <em>8 6 3</em>
  Best order:  [0 1 3 2 4]
  Shortest distance:  27.1016</pre>

<p>
(The parts in italics are the user's input.  For simplicity, we start all of
our numbering from 0.)
</p>

<p>
What the above output is saying, is that for the above five points, if they
are visited in the printed order, the path will only be ~27.1 units long, and
this is the shortest path that includes all five points.
</p>

<p>
This turns out to be a very straightforward program to write, using the STL's
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector"><tt>std::vector</tt></a>
data type.  Also, you should use your <tt>Point</tt> class from last week to
represent the individual 3D points in the inputs.  Finally, you should pass
<tt>const</tt>-references as arguments to the functions specified below; this
will require you to update your <tt>Point</tt> class with <tt>const</tt>
specifications where required.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <tt>std::vector</tt> class is declared in the <tt>&lt;vector&gt;</tt>
    C++ standard header.</li>
<li>You will need to use one of the STL algorithms specified below; these are
    declared in the <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> C++ standard header.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are functions you must write to implement this program:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><tt>double circuitLength(const vector&lt;Point&gt; &amp;points, const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;order)</tt></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  This function takes a vector of points, and the order in which those points
  are visited, and it computes the total length of the path when the points
  are traveled in the specified order.  Note that the path must be a complete
  round trip!  For example, if the <tt>order</tt> vector is <tt>[3, 1, 2, 0]</tt>,
  the total distance will include these components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The distance from <tt>points[3]</tt> to <tt>points[1]</tt></li>
    <li>The distance from <tt>points[1]</tt> to <tt>points[2]</tt></li>
    <li>The distance from <tt>points[2]</tt> to <tt>points[0]</tt></li>
    <li>The distance from <tt>points[0]</tt> to <tt>points[3]</tt></li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt><tt>vector&lt;int&gt; findShortestPath(const vector&lt;Point&gt; &amp;points)</tt></dt>
<dd>
  <p>
  This function takes a vector of points, and returns a vector that specifies
  the order to visit all of the points in a single round trip, visiting each
  point once, to ensure that the trip is as short as possible.  This is the
  function that will solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.  Of course,
  we will write a simple brute-force solution that will work for a small
  number of points, but it will be too slow for a large number of points.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The function can operate in this way:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Set up a <tt>vector&lt;int&gt;</tt> variable that holds the order in
        which the points will be visited.  Initially, the order can simply be
        [0, 1, ..., N-1], where N is the size of the <tt>points</tt> vector.</li>
    <li>You can compute the distance of this path and store it in a "shortest
        distance" variable, along with another variable that holds the "best
        path found so far" (it will also be a <tt>vector&lt;int&gt;</tt>).</li>
    <li>Next, the function can use the STL algorithm
        <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/next_permutation">
        <tt>bool next_permutation(Iterator first, Iterator last)</tt></a> to
        iterate through all permutations of your order-vector.  For each
        permutation, the loop can compute the total distance traveled for
        the permutation.  If the distance is shorter than the current
        "shortest distance," then the loop has found a new "best path."</li>
    <li>Finally, the function can return the best order it found in its
        loop.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The <tt>next_permutation()</tt> algorithm generates permutations in
  <em>lexicographic order</em>.  This terminology draws from permuting the
  characters in a string, where "lexicographic order" simply means
  alphabetical order.  For example, given the string "abc", you can order the
  permutations alphabetically as follows:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>abc</li>
    <li>acb</li>
    <li>bac</li>
    <li>bca</li>
    <li>cab</li>
    <li>cba</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Similarly, with our <tt>order</tt> vector, [0 1 2 ... N-2 N-1 N] is
  considered to be lexicographically "first" in the sequence of
  permutations.  The next one is [0 1 2 ... N-2 N N-1], and so forth.  The
  "last" permutation is [N N-1 N-2 ... 1 0].
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The important detail is that when <tt>next_permutation()</tt> "wraps around"
  from the lexicographically "last" permutation to the "first" permutation,
  it will return <tt>false</tt>; for all other permutations it will return
  <tt>true</tt>.  Therefore, your function can continue to iterate through
  permutations until <tt>next_permutation()</tt> returns <tt>false</tt>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  You will find that this implementation slows down very quickly as the
  number of points increases.  There are various ways you can improve the
  performance of this function, but you can use the above-described
  approach to find the answer.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><tt>int main()</tt></dt>

<dd>
  <p>
  This function will be pretty straightforward to write.  It should follow
  the example output specified earlier:  prompt the user for a number of
  points, then prompt for each point in turn.  The points should be collected
  into an STL vector.  Then, the <tt>main()</tt> function can call the
  <tt>findShortestPath()</tt> function to get the shortest path that visits
  all points once.  Finally, the program should print out the path found, and
  the total length of the path.
  </p>

  <p>
  Again, you should carefully follow the outputs shown earlier, so that we
  can automate the grading of your program.
  </p>
</dd></dl>

<p>
You can compile your program similar to last time:  <tt>g++ -std=c++14 -Wall tsp.cc Point.cc -o tsp</tt>
</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>
When you are ready to try your program, you can test it with some simple test
files provided below.  Just download the various test files, and then run
your <tt>tsp</tt> program against them:
</p>

<pre>  tsp &lt; test1.txt</pre>

<p>
This will feed the file's contents into your program as if you had typed it.
</p>

<p>
Note that your program's output might be slightly different from the given
output:  your path might start at a different point, and it may go in the
opposite order from the output given below.  Also, the computed distance may
be off by a <em>very</em> small amount; this is fine.
</p>
