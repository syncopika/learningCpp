<h2>Traveling Salesman Problem - Genetic Algorithms</h2>

<p>
For this assignment you will create a version of your Traveling Salesman
Problem solver that uses genetic algorithms (GAs) instead of a brute-force
approach.  Genetic algorithms allow you to explore many different solutions
at the same time, and the better solutions quickly percolate to the top of
the population, where they will hopefully produce even better solutions.
(Genetic algorithms have even been used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_antenna">design communications
antennas for space missions</a>!)

</p><p>
In the context of the Traveling Salesman Problem, the only drawback of
genetic algorithms is that we know they will produce a <em>good</em>
solution, but we can't assert that it is the <em>best</em> solution (unless
we already know what the best solution is, of course).  But, we can get to a
good solution surprisingly rapidly with GAs.
</p>

<p>
You will definitely want to cannibalize your code from last assignment!  You
can definitely reuse some of last week's work to complete this week's lab.
</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>
The general approach of genetic algorithms is straightforward.  The most
important part is to come up with some way of representing solutions to the
problem as a sequence of values.  This becomes the "genome" for a large
population of "creatures" or "individuals," each which has its own set of
values that specifies a potential solution to the problem being solved.
</p>

<p>
All members of the population are scored using a "fitness function" that
assigns a numeric value to how "good" each individual's solution is.  Then,
the best solutions are used to generate a new population that combines the
features of the previous population's best solutions.  Finally, the genetic
material of individuals in the population are "mutated" in some random way,
so that even more interesting solutions can be explored by the GA.
</p>

<p>
For our TSP solver, we will use the visit-order as the genome for the
individuals in our population.  For example, with a problem of 8 points, a
genome might be <tt>[5 2 0 4 7 1 3 6]</tt>, specifying the order that the
points are visited.  The fitness function is simple:  it is just the length
of the circuit formed by visiting the points in the specified order.
Individuals with "better" or "fitter" genomes will have a shorter path;
"worse" or "less fit" individuals will specify a longer path.
</p>

<h3>TSP Genomes</h3>

<p>
The first thing you will need to write for your solver is a
<tt>TSPGenome</tt> class that can represent one possible solution to a
Traveling Salesman Problem.  Create the class declaration in a file
<tt>tsp-ga.hh</tt>, and put the definitions in <tt>tsp-ga.cc</tt>.  (Make
sure to comment everything clearly, as usual.)
</p>

The class should have two data members:

<ul>
<li>An STL vector of integers, specifying the order that the points in the
    problem will be visited.</li>
<li>A <tt>double</tt> that will hold the "circuit length" - the total
    distance covered if the points are visited in a circuit, in the specified
    order.</li>
</ul>

The genome will need a few simple operations:

<ul>
<li>
  <p>
  A <tt>TSPGenome(int numPoints)</tt> constructor that takes the number of
  points that will be visited, and generates a random order to visit those
  points.  The constructor can simply push the numbers <tt>[0 1 2 3 ...
  numPoints-1]</tt> into a vector, and then use the
  <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle"><tt>random_shuffle()</tt></a>
  algorithm to randomly permute the vector.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  The circuit length should be initialized to some dummy value, such as -1,
  or perhaps a very large number like 10<sup>9</sup> (this can be written in
  C and C++ as <tt>1e9</tt>).
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  A <tt>TSPGenome(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;order)</tt> constructor that
  initializes the genome from the specified visit order.
  </p>

  <p>
  Again, the circuit length should be initialized to the same dummy value
  that is used in the other constructor.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  A member function <tt>vector&lt;int&gt; getOrder() const</tt> that returns
  the genome's current visit order.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  A member function <tt>computeCircuitLength</tt> that takes a
  const-reference to a vector of points, and computes the circuit length from
  traversing the points in the order specified in the object.  This value
  should be stored in the object.  The function doesn't need to return
  anything.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  (You can use your code from last week to implement this function.)
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  Another member function <tt>getCircuitLength</tt> that returns the circuit
  length.  Since the function doesn't change the object it's called on, it
  should also be marked <tt>const</tt>.
  </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mutating and Crosslinking Genomes</h3>

<p>
In order to build an effective genetic algorithm, you must also provide some
way to mutate the genes of an individual in the population.  (This allows the
GA to explore additional solutions beyond what is currently captured in the
population.)  Additionally, the "best" individuals need to be able to
reproduce, so you will need to implement a mechanism to produce an offspring
from two parents.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p>
  The mutation operation is very easy to implement.  Write another member
  function for your <tt>TSPGenome</tt> class called <tt>mutate()</tt>, that
  mutates the genome by swapping two randomly-selected values in the order
  vector.  The indexes of the values can be chosen using the <tt>rand()</tt>
  function from the <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> library; this function generates
  random integers.  You can produce a suitable value with the expression
  <tt>rand() % order.size()</tt>, which will generate a random value in the
  range [0, <em>size</em>-1].
  </p>
  <p>
  Your implementation should choose two <em>different</em> indexes to swap.
  This is easy enough; just loop as long as the second value is the same as
  the first value.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  Offspring should be generated by a function with the signature
  <tt>TSPGenome crosslink(const TSPGenome &amp;g1, const TSPGenome &amp;g2)</tt>.
  <b>This is not a member function; it should exist outside of the
  <tt>TSPGenome</tt> class.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  An easy way to implement this function is given in the lecture slides.
  Create a new <tt>vector&lt;int&gt;</tt> to hold the new offspring's order.
  Choose a random index <tt>i = rand() % g1.getOrder().size()</tt>. Then,
  copy <tt>g1</tt>'s order-values at indexes [0, i-1] to the new vector.
  Finally, iterate through <tt>g2</tt>'s <em>entire</em> vector, copying each
  value to the new result vector, as long as it doesn't already appear in the
  new vector.  This approach will ensure that you always generate a result
  that is valid (i.e. each value appears exactly once in the vector).
  </p>
  
  <p>
  You can use the STL <tt>std::set</tt> collection to keep track of which
  values you have added to the vector.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Finally, when you have created the new order-vector, you can use it to
  create a new <tt>TSPGenome</tt> object.
  </p>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Finding a Short Path</h3>

<p>
Once the above components have been implemented, you can implement this
function (again, not a member of <tt>TSPGenome</tt>, but still in the
<tt>tsp-ga.hh</tt> / <tt>tsp-ga.cc</tt> files):
</p>

<pre>  TSPGenome findAShortPath(const vector&lt;Point&gt; &amp;points,
                           int populationSize, int numGenerations,
                           int keepPopulation, int numMutations)</pre>

<p>
(Note that we call this "find a short path," because we really don't know if
it is the shortest path.)
</p>

<p>
The function works as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
  <p>
  Generate an initial population of random genomes.  The population size is
  specified in the argument to the function.  The size of each genome is
  the number of points.
  </p>
</li>
    
<li>
  <p>
  Iterate over the population and compute the circuit length for each
  member.
  </p>
</li>
    
<li>
  <p>
  Since the circuit length is the fitness function, we can now sort the
  vector of genomes with the circuit length.  You can create a simple
  helper function (I put mine right before my implementation of
  <tt>findAShortPath()</tt>) with this signature:
  </p>
    
  <pre>    bool isShorterPath(const TSPGenome &amp;g1, const TSPGenome &amp;g2)</pre>
  
  <p>  
  The function should return <tt>true</tt> if <tt>g1</tt> has a shorter
  circuit length than <tt>g2</tt>; <tt>false</tt> otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can pass this function to the <tt>std::sort()</tt> algorithm, to sort
  the TSP genomes by fitness.  (The "fittest" ones should be at the lowest
  indexes.)
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  So you know what is going on, you should add some code that prints out the
  fitness of the best solution, every 10 generations.  It can be something
  like this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>    // gen is the generation #; it starts at 0
    // population is the vector of TSP genomes
    if (gen % 10 == 0) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Generation " &lt;&lt; gen &lt;&lt; ":  shortest path is "
             &lt;&lt; population[0].getCircuitLength() &lt;&lt; endl;
    }</pre>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  Now you need to keep the top N fittest members of the population, but
  replace the remaining members with new genomes produced from the fittest
  ones.  The <tt>keepPopulation</tt> argument specifies how many individuals
  to keep from the existing population; they will be at the indexes
  [0, <tt>keepPopulation</tt>-1].
  </p>
  
  <p>
  It's pretty easy to generate new genomes into the existing population,
  overwriting the existing members.  You can do something like this:
  </p>
  
  <pre>  for i in [keepPopulation, populationSize):
      set g1 = a random index in the range [0, keepPopulation)
      set g2 = a <u>different</u> random index in the range [0, keepPopulation)
      
      set population[i] = crosslink(population[g1], population[g2])</pre>
  
  <p>
  Again, you can choose a random index using the same expression as before:
  <tt>rand() % keepPopulation</tt> will generate a value in the range
  <tt>[0, keepPopulation - 1]</tt>.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  Next you get to mutate things!  This is the purpose of the
  <tt>numMutations</tt> argument:  it specifies how many mutations to apply
  to the population.  You can implement a simple loop that chooses a random
  index, then calls <tt>mutate()</tt> on the genome at that index.
  </p>
  <p>
  It would probably be best to <em>not</em> mutate the genome at index 0,
  since it is the best solution found so far.  This is pretty easy to do
  with an exmpression like:  <tt>1 + rand() % (populationSize - 1)</tt>
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
  If you haven't already completed all generations, go back to step 2!
  Otherwise, return <tt>population[0]</tt>, since this will be the best
  solution found so far.
  </p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Main Program</h3>

<p>
Once you have completed all of the above work, it's time to create a
<tt>main()</tt> function that will read in points and then call your TSP
genetic algorithm to find a solution.  Do this in a file
<tt>tsp-main.cc</tt>.  You can start with your previous lab's <tt>main()</tt>
function, and alter it according to the requirements below.
</p>

<p>
This time your program should take the following command-line arguments:
</p>

<pre>  ./tsp-ga population generations keep mutate</pre>

<ul>
<li><tt>population</tt> is a positive integer specifying the population
    size</li>
<li><tt>generations</tt> is a positive integer specifying how many
    generations to run the GA for</li>
<li><tt>keep</tt> is a floating-point value in the range 0-1 that specifies
    the percentage of the population that should be preserved from
    generation to generation.  For example, 0.3 would specify that the top
    30% of the population should be preserved to the next generation.</li>
<li><tt>mutate</tt> is a nonnegative floating-point value that specifies how
    many mutations to apply to each member of the population, on average.
    For example, a value of 1.5 specifies that each member will have about
    1.5 mutations applied.  The total number of mutations to apply to the
    population is simply <em>mutate</em> &amp;mult; <em>population</em> at the
    end of each generation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the program doesn't get the proper number of arguments, or if it gets
values that are not in the proper ranges, show a usage message and then
terminate the program.  You can use the <tt>atoi()</tt> and <tt>atof()</tt>
functions for argument parsing; don't worry about detecting if the arguments
are all valid numbers.
</p>

<p>
Besides the new arguments, the program should operate as before:  First,
prompt the user for how many points, and then prompt for each point.  Next,
call the <tt>findAShortPath()</tt> function with the appropriate parameters
based on the command-line arguments.
</p>

<p>
You will probably want to seed the random number generator so that it will
generate a different random sequence each time it runs.  You can do this
by including the <tt>&lt;ctime&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>
headers, and then adding this line:  <tt>srand(time(nullptr));</tt>
</p>

<p>
When the program has finished running the number of generations specified,
it should print out the length of the shortest path found, along with the
path itself, and then exit.
</p>

<h3>Testing Your Program</h3>

<p>
You can test your program with any of the test files from the previous lab,
but you will probably find they are not that challenging to your new program.
So, here are some new files to use.  Note that we don't have the shortest
circuit and the length of it, because the inputs are prohibitively large to
use with the previous program.
</p>

<li><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/cpp/donnie/lab3/test-500.txt"><tt>test-500.txt</tt></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
With the <tt>test-12.txt</tt> file from last week, my <tt>tsp</tt> program
takes about 1 minute 20 seconds to complete.  The best order is
[2 6 4 1 11 10 9 0 5 7 3 8], and the distance is 47.6887.
</p>

<p>
Here is example output from running the TSP GA solver on the same input.
It can reliably find the best path in approximately 7 seconds.
</p>

<pre>./tsp-ga 1000 100 .4 1 &lt; test-12.txt
... <em>(prompts for # of points, etc.)</em> ...
Generation 0:  shortest path is 60.4167
Generation 10:  shortest path is 50.2302
Generation 20:  shortest path is 50.2302
Generation 30:  shortest path is 47.6887
Generation 40:  shortest path is 47.6887
Generation 50:  shortest path is 47.6887
Generation 60:  shortest path is 47.6887
Generation 70:  shortest path is 47.6887
Generation 80:  shortest path is 47.6887
Generation 90:  shortest path is 47.6887
Best order:  [1 11 10 9 0 5 7 3 8 2 6 4]
Shortest distance:  47.6887</pre>

<p>
You will notice that the path is rotated from the first program's path, but
it is still the same path.  You may notice that your solver may generate
paths in the opposite direction as well.
</p>
