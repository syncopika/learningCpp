trying out the SDL2 library! :D     
    
demo1: this demo demonstrates some features of SDL, such as image loading, image scaling, converting surface to texture, and handling some basic input like mouse clicks (the image changes on click).

demo2: this demo lets you control a character and do some fishing! If you're lucky, you might catch something! I practiced some OOP here and implemented some very elementary collision detection.
