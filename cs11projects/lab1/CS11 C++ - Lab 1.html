<h2>C++ Lab 1:  Jumping Right In</h2>
<i>working with objects</i>

<!--
<br />
<b>Due Thursday, January 18, 12:00pm.</b>
-->

<hr>

<p>
  C++ lets us program with <i>objects</i>.  We describe objects in C++ by
  declaring and defining <i>classes</i>.  We <i>declare</i> our class's
  structure in a header file, just like in C, and <i>define</i> it (that is,
  write the code that actually does the work) in a corresponding source code
  file.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a sample header file <tt>Point.hh</tt> that describes an object that
  represents a point in two-dimensional Euclidean space:
</p>

<pre> // A 2D point class!
 class Point {

 private:
     // Coordinates of the point.
     double x_coord;
     double y_coord;

 public:
     // Constructors
     Point();				// Default constructor
     Point(double x, double y);		// Two-argument constructor

     // Destructor
     ~Point();

     // Accessor methods
     double getX();
     double getY();

     // Mutator methods
     void setX(double val);
     void setY(double val);
 };	
</pre>

<p>
  We can <i>instantiate</i>, or create an instance of, our class anywhere in the
  rest of our code by calling any of the constructors we have defined:
</p>

<pre> Point myPoint;            // Calls Point::Point()
 Point myOtherPoint(5, 3); // Calls two-argument constructor Point::Point(double, double)
</pre>

<h3>Your Task</h3>

<ol>

  <li>
    <p>
      Copy the source code for the Point class (<a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~donnie/cs11/cpp/lab1/Point.hh">Point.hh</a>
      and <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~donnie/cs11/cpp/lab1/Point.cc">Point.cc</a>) to a convenient working directory.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Change the <tt>Point</tt> class to represent points in three dimensions.
      Make sure to update the comments to match this change!
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Add a new member function to <tt>Point</tt> called <tt>distanceTo</tt>.
      This member function should accept as an argument a
      <u><tt>Point &amp;</tt></u> (a reference to a <tt>Point</tt>), and it
      should return a <tt>double</tt> that approximates the distance between the
      two points.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will probably find a square-root function useful for this!  The C
      standard library has one, called <tt>sqrt()</tt>.  The function takes a
      double and returns another double.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were programming in C, you would <tt>#include &lt;math.h&gt;</tt>,
      but in C++ you say <tt>#include &lt;cmath&gt;</tt>.  (This means, "Include
      the C Math header.")  And then you are all set.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Create a new source file <tt>lab1.cc</tt> and implement two functions:

      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <tt>double computeArea(Point &amp;a, Point &amp;b, Point &amp;c)</tt>
          </p>
          <p>
            which takes by reference three <tt>Point</tt> objects,
            computes the area within the triangle defined by these
            points (hint: use
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula">Heron's
            Formula</a>), and returns it as a double-precision
            floating point number.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <tt>int main()</tt>
          </p>
          <p>
            which requests three points (nine coordinates) from the user,
            determines the area inside the triangle described by the three
            points using the aforementioned function, and displays the result.
          </p>
          <p>
            In C++, you don't have to declare all variables at the top of a
            block; you can intermingle variable declarations and statements of
            code.  So, you should only need to use three <tt>double</tt>
            variables to input the coordinates, and then create each
            <tt>Point</tt> along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Don't worry about dealing with bad user input.</b>  For now, you
            can follow the oft-used program behavior:  "Garbage in, garbage
            out!"
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      Compile these sources together like so:
      </p><pre>  g++ -Wall lab1.cc Point.cc -o lab1</pre>

      Remember:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>g++</tt> is the GNU C++ compiler.</li>
        <li>
          <tt>-Wall</tt> means "output ALL warnings."  (If you see any
          warnings, be sure to fix them.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Next comes the list of source files.  (You don't list header files
          here.  They are included by the source files.)  The only new part here
          is that we have <i>two</i> files:  <tt>lab1.cc</tt> and
          <tt>Point.cc</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <tt>-o</tt> specifies the output file.  In this case, we are making a
          program called <tt>lab1</tt>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Run the generated program:
      </p><pre>  ./lab1</pre>
    <p></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Go back and test <tt>computeArea</tt> with several boundary and/or extreme
      cases to make sure your implementation is robust for all triangles,
      including degenerate ones.  Things you might try:

      </p><ul>
        <li>Triangles with no area - all three points on the same line</li>
        <li>Triangles where two points are the same</li>
        <li>Triangles where all three points are the same</li>
        <li>Triangles with negative coordinate values</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      In software-engineering parlance, these degenerate cases are called
      "edge cases" or "corner cases," because they test combinations of inputs
      that may be rare, but still possible.  Usually, you want to start out by
      seeing if your program can handle simple cases that will expose obvious
      issues.  Once your program can handle these, then you move on to the more
      subtle test scenarios.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>
  That's it!  Once you are finished, and have tested your code, submit your

  website</a>, for Lab 1 of the CS11 Intro C++ track!  If you need a csman
  account, or if you aren't in the Intro C++ class, then please
  <a href="mailto:donnie@cs.caltech.edu">email Donnie</a> to get things set up.
